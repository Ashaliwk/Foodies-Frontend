                <p class="fs-5">The Foodies was born out of a desire to reconnect children with their food in a way
                    which doesn't
                    preach or make <br> them feel confused or ashamed. Instead we focus on helping children to see the
                    everyday joy in food. The miracle <br> of a tiny seed turning into a huge plant and bearing baskets
                    of
                    produce. The magic of taking a raw ingredient and <br> transforming it into something totally
                    different
                    through cooking. The endless adventure of trying different foods <br> and exploring their tastes and
                    textures. The deep connection we feel when we use food to make relationships with <br> other people
                    and
                    their food cultures.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 fs-5">We live in an age of contradictions around food. On one hand there is a feeling of
                    endless abundance
                    and <br> permanent global summertime, meaning we can theoretically get any food any time we want. On
                    the
                    other hand, <br> the reality is that the food system which enables that illusion relies on an ever
                    narrower range of varieties of foods, <br> to be shelf stable and transportable. What looks like
                    abundance is actually just volume.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 fs-5">Many of the foods we are eating are making us unhealthy, and messages around
                    healthy eating are often <br>
                    confusing. And for many people in the world, including in our own neighbourhoods, food insecurity
                    means that <br> access to fresh healthy food is far from a given. We all know in our hearts that our
                    planet cannot sustain the way <br> we are eating, and global warming is only making food security
                    issues
                    worse. In our busy lives it is easy to get <br> overwhelmed with all of the messaging around food.
                    The
                    weekly shop can make us feel anxious and guilty. </p>

                    The Foodies was created to give small steps which anyone can try. <br>
                    Start with connecting your children to the seasons and how things grow. <br>
                    You don't need a garden - that's what we are here for! <br>
                    Start with one new fruit or vegetable a month. One recipe a month. <br>
                    It doesn't sound like much, but if your child tries one food a month from today, before long you
                    will be
                    able to <br> choose 30 or 40 different fruits and vegetables to put on your table. Can you imagine
                    what that
                    would feel like?</p>
